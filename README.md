## üîπ 1. What is a _Graph_?

### Answer

A **graph** is a data structure that represents a collection of interconnected **nodes** through a set of **edges**.

This abstract structure is highly versatile and finds applications in various domains, from social network analysis to computer networking.

### Core Components

A graph consists of two main components:

1. **Nodes**: Also called **vertices**, these are the fundamental units that hold data.
2. **Edges**: These are the connections between nodes, and they can be either **directed** or **undirected**.

### Visual Representation

### Graph Representations

There are several ways to represent graphs in computer memory, with the most common ones being **adjacency matrix**, **adjacency list**, and **edge list**.

#### Adjacency Matrix

In an adjacency matrix, a 2D Boolean array indicates the edges between nodes. A value of `True` at index `[i][j]` means that an edge exists between nodes `i` and `j`.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = [
    [False, True, True],
    [True, False, True],
    [True, True, False]
]
```

#### Adjacency List

An adjacency list represents each node as a list, and the indices of the list are the nodes. Each node's list contains the nodes that it is directly connected to.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1]
}
```

#### Edge List

An edge list is a simple list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge between two nodes.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]
```

## üîπ 2. What are some common _Types_ and _Categories_ of _Graphs_?

### Answer

Graphs serve as **adaptable data structures** for various computational tasks and real-world applications. Let's look at their diverse types.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Undirected**: Edges lack direction, allowing free traversal between connected nodes. Mathematically, $(u,v)$ as an edge implies $(v,u)$ as well.
2. **Directed (Digraph)**: Edges have a set direction, restricting traversal accordingly. An edge $(u,v)$ doesn't guarantee $(v,u)$.

![Graph Types: Unidirected, Directed](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdirection.png?alt=media&token=187d88ba-04f3-4993-bbcf-f3bc35c41c0d)

#### Weight Considerations

1. **Weighted**: Each edge has a numerical "weight" or "cost."
2. **Unweighted**: All edges are equal in weight, typically considered as 1.

![Graph Types: Weighted, Unweighted](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fweight.png?alt=media&token=c975e0b9-4c21-4518-8c7e-9489279b642b)

#### Presence of Cycles

1. **Cyclic**: Contains at least one cycle or closed path.
2. **Acyclic**: Lacks cycles entirely.

![Graph Types: Cyclic, Acyclic](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fcyclic.png?alt=media&token=f072557c-d298-4c73-b5b8-11ca014eeb08)

#### Edge Density

1. **Dense**: High edge-to-vertex ratio, nearing the maximum possible connections.
2. **Sparse**: Low edge-to-vertex ratio, closer to the minimum.

![Graph Types: Sparse, Dense](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdensity.png?alt=media&token=084eec75-b348-4429-ae30-788ac7f49778)

#### Connectivity

1. **Connected**: Every vertex is reachable from any other vertex.
2. **Disconnected**: Some vertices are unreachable from others.

![Graph Types: Connected, Disconnected](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fconnected-disconnected-graph.png?alt=media&token=3aa6db3e-852e-4c62-a42d-a6ebf501d9f7)

#### Edge Uniqueness

1. **Multigraph**: Allows duplicate edges between vertices.
2. **Simple**: Limits vertices to a single connecting edge.

## üîπ 3. What are some real-world _Applications_ of _Graphs_?

### Answer

**Graphs** are foundational to numerous domains, **directly or indirectly** influencing our daily activities. Whether you're navigating online, problem-solving, or gaming, chances are you're benefiting from graph-based systems and algorithms.

### Practical Applications

1. **Computer Networks**: Graphs model the connections between routers and servers.
  
2. **Core Data Structures**: Trees and linked lists are special types of graphs.
  
3. **Routing Algorithms**: Essential for GPS and mapping services like Google Maps.

4. **Constraint Resolution**: Useful in scheduling and optimization tasks, such as university course scheduling.

5. **Chemical Modeling**: Represents molecular structures for better understanding of chemical interactions.

6. **Project Management**: Aids in activity scheduling and resource allocation.

7. **Code Parsing**: Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in compilers are specific kinds of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

8. **State Control**: State machines govern various systems, from network protocols to video games.

9. **Machine Learning Pipelines**: Involved in data preprocessing and relationship modeling.

10. **Text Recognition**: Vital in optical character recognition algorithms.

11. **Decision-making Algorithms**: Employed in logistics, finance, and more for optimal choices.

### Graphs in Modern Tech

The influence of **graph theory** extends to several cutting-edge technologies:

- **Web Search**: Graphs help optimize and analyze the structure of the internet for search engines.

- **Social Media**: Platforms like Facebook function fundamentally as expansive graphs.

## üîπ 4. Compare _Adjacency Lists_ and _Adjacency Matrices_ for graph representation.

### Answer

Graphs can be represented in various ways, but **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List** are the most commonly used data structures. Each method offers distinct advantages and trade-offs, which we'll explore below.

![Example Graph](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/graph-theory/images/graph-representations1.png)

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Requires a $N \times N$ matrix, resulting in $O(N^2)$ space complexity.
- **Adjacency List**: Utilizes a list or array for each node's neighbors, leading to $O(N + E)$ space complexity, where $E$ is the number of edges.

### Time Complexity for Edge Look-Up

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Constant time, $O(1)$, as the presence of an edge is directly accessible.
- **Adjacency List**: Up to $O(k)$, where $k$ is the degree of the vertex, as the list of neighbors may need to be traversed.

### Time Complexity for Traversal

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Requires $O(N^2)$ time to iterate through all potential edges.
- **Adjacency List**: Takes $O(N + E)$ time, often faster for sparse graphs.

### Time Complexity for Edge Manipulation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: $O(1)$ for both addition and removal, as it involves updating a single cell.
- **Adjacency List**: $O(k)$ for addition or removal, where $k$ is the degree of the vertex involved.

### Time Complexity for Vertex Manipulation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: $O(N^2)$ as resizing the matrix is needed.
- **Adjacency List**: $O(1)$ as it involves updating a list or array.

### Code Example: Adjacency Matrix & Adjacency List

Here is the Python code:

```python
adj_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
]

adj_list = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 3],
    [0, 5],
    [1, 4, 5],
    [3],
    [2, 3]
]
```

## üîπ 5. What is the difference between a _Tree_ and a _Graph_?

### Answer

**Graphs** and **trees** are both nonlinear data structures, but there are fundamental distinctions between them.

### Key Distinctions

- **Uniqueness**: Trees have a single root, while graphs may not have such a concept.
- **Topology**: Trees are **hierarchical**, while graphs can exhibit various structures.
-  **Focus**: Graphs center on relationships between individual nodes, whereas trees emphasize the relationship between nodes and a common root.

### Graphs: Versatile and Unstructured

- **Elements**: Composed of vertices/nodes (denoted as V) and edges (E) representing relationships. Multiple edges and **loops** are possible.
- **Directionality**: Edges can be directed or undirected.
- **Connectivity**: May be **disconnected**, with sets of vertices that aren't reachable from others.
- **Loops**: Can contain cycles.

### Trees: Hierarchical and Organized

- **Elements**: Consist of nodes with parent-child relationships.
- **Directionality**: Edges are strictly parent-to-child.
- **Connectivity**: Every node is accessible from the unique root node.
- **Loops**: Cycles are not allowed.
