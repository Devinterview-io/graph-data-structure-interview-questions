## 1. What is a _Graph_?

A **graph** is a data structure that represents a collection of interconnected **nodes** through a set of **edges**.

This abstract structure is highly versatile and finds applications in various domains, from social network analysis to computer networking.

### Core Components

A graph consists of two main components:

1. **Nodes**: Also called **vertices**, these are the fundamental units that hold data.
2. **Edges**: These are the connections between nodes, and they can be either **directed** or **undirected**.

### Visual Representation

### Graph Representations

There are several ways to represent graphs in computer memory, with the most common ones being **adjacency matrix**, **adjacency list**, and **edge list**.

#### Adjacency Matrix

In an adjacency matrix, a 2D Boolean array indicates the edges between nodes. A value of `True` at index `[i][j]` means that an edge exists between nodes `i` and `j`.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = [
    [False, True, True],
    [True, False, True],
    [True, True, False]
]
```

#### Adjacency List

An adjacency list represents each node as a list, and the indices of the list are the nodes. Each node's list contains the nodes that it is directly connected to.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1]
}
```

#### Edge List

An edge list is a simple list of tuples, where each tuple represents an edge between two nodes.

Here is the Python code:

```python
graph = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]
```
<br>

## 2. What are some common _Types_ and _Categories_ of _Graphs_?

Graphs serve as **adaptable data structures** for various computational tasks and real-world applications. Let's look at their diverse types.

### Types of Graphs

1. **Undirected**: Edges lack direction, allowing free traversal between connected nodes. Mathematically, $(u,v)$ as an edge implies $(v,u)$ as well.
2. **Directed (Digraph)**: Edges have a set direction, restricting traversal accordingly. An edge $(u,v)$ doesn't guarantee $(v,u)$.

![Graph Types: Unidirected, Directed](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdirection.png?alt=media&token=187d88ba-04f3-4993-bbcf-f3bc35c41c0d)

#### Weight Considerations

1. **Weighted**: Each edge has a numerical "weight" or "cost."
2. **Unweighted**: All edges are equal in weight, typically considered as 1.

![Graph Types: Weighted, Unweighted](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fweight.png?alt=media&token=c975e0b9-4c21-4518-8c7e-9489279b642b)

#### Presence of Cycles

1. **Cyclic**: Contains at least one cycle or closed path.
2. **Acyclic**: Lacks cycles entirely.

![Graph Types: Cyclic, Acyclic](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fcyclic.png?alt=media&token=f072557c-d298-4c73-b5b8-11ca014eeb08)

#### Edge Density

1. **Dense**: High edge-to-vertex ratio, nearing the maximum possible connections.
2. **Sparse**: Low edge-to-vertex ratio, closer to the minimum.

![Graph Types: Sparse, Dense](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdensity.png?alt=media&token=084eec75-b348-4429-ae30-788ac7f49778)

#### Connectivity

1. **Connected**: Every vertex is reachable from any other vertex.
2. **Disconnected**: Some vertices are unreachable from others.

![Graph Types: Connected, Disconnected](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fconnected-disconnected-graph.png?alt=media&token=3aa6db3e-852e-4c62-a42d-a6ebf501d9f7)

#### Edge Uniqueness

1. **Multigraph**: Allows duplicate edges between vertices.
2. **Simple**: Limits vertices to a single connecting edge.

![Graph Types: Multigraph, Simple Graph](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fsimple-multigraph.png?alt=media&token=a7c888e1-a317-470c-94b8-bf998880bdd7)
<br>

## 3. What is the difference between a _Tree_ and a _Graph_?

**Graphs** and **trees** are both nonlinear data structures, but there are fundamental distinctions between them.

### Key Distinctions

- **Uniqueness**: Trees have a single root, while graphs may not have such a concept.
- **Topology**: Trees are **hierarchical**, while graphs can exhibit various structures.
-  **Focus**: Graphs center on relationships between individual nodes, whereas trees emphasize the relationship between nodes and a common root.

### Graphs: Versatile and Unstructured

- **Elements**: Composed of vertices/nodes (denoted as V) and edges (E) representing relationships. Multiple edges and **loops** are possible.
- **Directionality**: Edges can be directed or undirected.
- **Connectivity**: May be **disconnected**, with sets of vertices that aren't reachable from others.
- **Loops**: Can contain cycles.

### Trees: Hierarchical and Organized

- **Elements**: Consist of nodes with parent-child relationships.
- **Directionality**: Edges are strictly parent-to-child.
- **Connectivity**: Every node is accessible from the unique root node.
- **Loops**: Cycles are not allowed.

### Visual Representation

<br>

## 4. How can you determine the _Minimum number of edges_ for a graph to remain connected?

To ensure a graph remains **connected**, it must have a minimum number of edges determined by the number of vertices. This is known as the **edge connectivity** of the graph.

### Edge Connectivity Formula

The minimum number of edges required for a graph to remain connected is given by:

$$
\text{{Edge Connectivity}} = \max(\delta(G),1)
$$

Where:
- $\delta(G)$ is the minimum degree of a vertex in $G$.
- The maximum function ensures that the graph remains connected even if all vertices have a degree of 1 or 0.

For example, a graph with a minimum vertex degree of 3 or more requires at least 3 edges to stay connected.
<br>

## 5. Define _Euler Path_ and _Euler Circuit_ in the context of graph theory.

In **graph theory**, an **Euler Path** and an **Euler Circuit** serve as methods to visit all edges (links) exactly once, with the distinction that an Euler Circuit also visits all vertices once.

### Euler Path and Euler Circuit Definitions

A graph has an **Euler Path** if it contains exactly two vertices of odd degree.

A graph has an **Euler Circuit** if every vertex has even degree.

**Degree** specifies the number of edges adjacent to a vertex.

### Key Concepts

- **Starting Vertex**: In an Euler Path, the unique starting and ending vertices are the two with odd degrees.
- **Reachability**: In both Euler Path and Circuit, every edge must be reachable from the starting vertex.
- **Direction-Consistency**: While an Euler Path is directionally open-ended, an Euler Circuit is directionally closed.

### Visual Representation: Euler Path and Circuit

<br>

## 6. Compare _Adjacency Lists_ and _Adjacency Matrices_ for graph representation.

Graphs can be represented in various ways, but **Adjacency Matrix** and **Adjacency List** are the most commonly used data structures. Each method offers distinct advantages and trade-offs, which we'll explore below.

![Example Graph](https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/graph-theory/images/graph-representations1.png)

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Requires a $N \times N$ matrix, resulting in $O(N^2)$ space complexity.
- **Adjacency List**: Utilizes a list or array for each node's neighbors, leading to $O(N + E)$ space complexity, where $E$ is the number of edges.

### Time Complexity for Edge Look-Up

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Constant time, $O(1)$, as the presence of an edge is directly accessible.
- **Adjacency List**: Up to $O(k)$, where $k$ is the degree of the vertex, as the list of neighbors may need to be traversed.

### Time Complexity for Traversal

- **Adjacency Matrix**: Requires $O(N^2)$ time to iterate through all potential edges.
- **Adjacency List**: Takes $O(N + E)$ time, often faster for sparse graphs.

### Time Complexity for Edge Manipulation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: $O(1)$ for both addition and removal, as it involves updating a single cell.
- **Adjacency List**: $O(k)$ for addition or removal, where $k$ is the degree of the vertex involved.

### Time Complexity for Vertex Manipulation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: $O(N^2)$ as resizing the matrix is needed.
- **Adjacency List**: $O(1)$ as it involves updating a list or array.

### Code Example: Adjacency Matrix & Adjacency List

Here is the Python code:

```python
adj_matrix = [
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
]

adj_list = [
    [1, 2],
    [0, 3],
    [0, 5],
    [1, 4, 5],
    [3],
    [2, 3]
]
```
<br>

## 7. What is an _Incidence Matrix_, and when would you use it?

An **incidence matrix** is a binary graph representation that maps vertices to edges. It's especially useful  for **directed** and **multigraphs**. The matrix contains $0$s and $1$s, with positions corresponding to "vertex connected to edge" relationships.

### Matrix Structure

- **Columns**: Represent edges
- **Rows**: Represent vertices
- **Cells**: Indicate whether a vertex is connected to an edge

Each unique **row-edge pair** depicts an incidence of a vertex in an edge, relating to the graph's structure differently based on the graph type.

### Example: Incidence Matrix for a Directed Graph

![Directed Graph](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdirected-graph1.png?alt=media&token=aa5733dc-b79a-4a5f-8f4d-127e1c7b5130)

### Example: Incidence Matrix for an Undirected Multigraph

![Uniderected Graph](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fundirected-graph1.png?alt=media&token=224b6d3a-a2ab-432d-8691-a83483b88cc8)

### Applications of Incidence Matrices

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Certain matrix operations can be faster than graph traversals.
- **Graph Comparisons**: It enables direct graph-to-matrix or matrix-to-matrix comparisons.
- **Database Storage**: A way to represent graphs in databases amongst others.
- **Graph Transformations**: Useful in transformations like line graphs and dual graphs.
<br>

## 8. Discuss _Edge List_ as a graph representation and its use cases.

**Edge list** is a straightforward way to represent graphs. It's apt for dense graphs and offers a quick way to query edge information.

### Key Concepts

- **Edge Storage**: The list contains tuples (a, b) to denote an edge between nodes $a$ and $b$.
- **Edge Direction**: The edges can be directed or undirected.
- **Edge Duplicates**: Multiple occurrences signal multigraph. Absence ensures simple graph.

### Visual Example

![Edge List Example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fedge-list.png?alt=media&token=d1bbe33f-c145-4c40-aff3-a6c4f1e80554)

### Code Example: Edge List

Here is the Python 3 code:

```python
# Example graph
edges = {('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'D'), ('B', 'D'), ('D', 'E')}

# Check existence
print(('A', 'B') in edges)  # True
print(('B', 'A') in edges)  # False
print(('A', 'E') in edges)  # False

# Adding an edge
edges.add(('E', 'C'))

# Removing an edge
edges.remove(('D', 'E'))

print(edges)  # Updated set: {('A', 'C'), ('B', 'D'), ('C', 'D'), ('A', 'B'), ('E', 'C'), ('B', 'C')}
```
<br>

## 9. Explain how to save space while storing a graph using _Compressed Sparse Row_ (CSR).

In **Compressed Sparse Row** format, the graph is represented by three linked arrays. This streamlined approach can significantly reduce memory use and is especially beneficial for **sparse graphs**.

Let's go through the data structures and the detailed process.

### Data Structures

1. **Indptr Array (IA)**: A list of indices where each row starts in the `adj_indices` array. It's of length `n_vertices + 1`.
2. **Adjacency Index Array (AA)**: The column indices for each edge based on their position in the `indptr` array.
3. **Edge Data**: The actual edge data. This array's length matches the number of non-zero elements.


### Visual Representation

![CSR Graph Representation](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fcompressed-sparse-row1.png?alt=media&token=aa1b2449-f800-4962-a7f3-f94431272191)

### Code Example: CSR Graph Representation

Here is the Python code:

```python
indptr = [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
indices = [2, 4, 0, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3]
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Reading from the CSR Format
for i in range(len(indptr) - 1):
    start = indptr[i]
    end = indptr[i + 1]
    print(f"Vertex {i} is connected to vertices {indices[start:end]} with data {data[start:end]}")

# Writing a CSR Represented Graph
# Vertices 0 to 5, Inclusive.
# 0 -> [2, 3, 4] - Data [3, 5, 7]
# 1 -> [0] - Data [1]
# 2 -> [] - No outgoing edges.
# 3 -> [1] - Data [2]
# 4 -> [3] - Data [4]
# 5 -> [2] - Data [6]

# Code to populate:
# indptr =  [0, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7]
# indices = [2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 3, 2]
# data = [3, 5, 7, 1, 2, 4, 6]
```
<br>

## 10. Explain the _Breadth-First Search_ (BFS) traversing method.

**Breadth-First Search** (BFS) is a graph traversal technique that systematically explores a graph level by level. It uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to visit next and a list to record visited nodes, avoiding redundancy.

### Key Components

- **Queue**: Maintains nodes in line for exploration.
- **Visited List**: Records nodes that have already been explored.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Choose a starting node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.
2. **Explore**: Keep iterating as long as the queue is not empty. In each iteration, dequeue a node, visit it, and enqueue its unexplored neighbors.
3. **Terminate**: Stop when the queue is empty.

### Visual Representation

![BFS Example](https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BFS-correction.jpg)

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(V + E)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph and $E$ is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and each edge will be explored only once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$ since, in the worst case, all of the vertices can be inside the queue.

### Code Example: Breadth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        if vertex not in visited:
            print(vertex, end=' ')
            visited.add(vertex)
            queue.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)

# Sample graph representation using adjacency sets
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'D', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'A', 'F'},
    'E': {'B'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'G': {'A'}
}

# Execute BFS starting from 'A'
bfs(graph, 'A')
# Expected Output: 'A B D G E F C'
```
<br>

## 11. Explain the _Depth-First Search_ (DFS) algorithm.

**Depth-First Search** (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that's simpler and **often faster** than its breadth-first counterpart (BFS). While it **might not explore all vertices**, DFS is still fundamental to numerous graph algorithms.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialize**: Select a starting vertex, mark it as visited, and put it on a stack.
2. **Loop**: Until the stack is empty, do the following:
   - Remove the top vertex from the stack.
   - Explore its unvisited neighbors and add them to the stack.
3. **Finish**: When the stack is empty, the algorithm ends, and all reachable vertices are visited.

### Visual Representation

![DFS Example](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/graph-theory%2Fdepth-first-search.jpg?alt=media&token=37b6d8c3-e5e1-4de8-abba-d19e36afc570)

### Code Example: Depth-First Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def dfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]
    
    while stack:
        vertex = stack.pop()
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            stack.extend(neighbor for neighbor in graph[vertex] if neighbor not in visited)
    
    return visited

# Example graph
graph = {
    'A': {'B', 'G'},
    'B': {'A', 'E', 'F'},
    'G': {'A'},
    'E': {'B', 'G'},
    'F': {'B', 'C', 'D'},
    'C': {'F'},
    'D': {'F'}
}

print(dfs(graph, 'A'))  # Output: {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}
```
<br>

## 12. What are the key differences between _BFS_ and _DFS_?

**BFS** and **DFS** are both essential graph traversal algorithms with distinct characteristics in strategy, memory requirements, and use-cases.

### Core Differences

1. **Search Strategy**: BFS moves level-by-level, while DFS goes deep into each branch before backtracking.
2. **Data Structures**: BFS uses a Queue, whereas DFS uses a Stack or recursion.
3. **Space Complexity**: BFS requires more memory as it may need to store an entire level ($O(|V|)$), whereas DFS usually uses less ($O(\log n)$ on average).
4. **Optimality**: BFS guarantees the shortest path; DFS does not.

### Code Example: BFS & DFS

Here is the Python code:

```python
# BFS
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = [start]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)
            
# DFS
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    for next_node in graph[start] - visited:
        dfs(graph, next_node, visited)
```
<br>

## 13. Implement a method to check if there is a _Path between two vertices_ in a graph.

### Problem Statement

Given an **undirected** graph, the task is to determine whether or not there is a **path** between two specified vertices.

### Solution

The problem can be solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**.

#### Algorithm Steps

1. Start from the source vertex.
2. For each adjacent vertex, if not visited, recursively perform DFS.
3. If the destination vertex is found, return `True`. Otherwise, backtrack and explore other paths.

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(V + E)$  
  $V$ is the number of vertices, and $E$ is the number of edges.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$  
  For the stack used in recursive DFS calls.

#### Implementation

Here is the Python code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

    def add_edge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)
        self.graph[v].append(u)

    def is_reachable(self, src, dest, visited):
        visited[src] = True

        if src == dest:
            return True

        for neighbor in self.graph[src]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if self.is_reachable(neighbor, dest, visited):
                    return True

        return False

    def has_path(self, src, dest):
        visited = defaultdict(bool)
        return self.is_reachable(src, dest, visited)

# Usage
g = Graph()
g.add_edge(0, 1)
g.add_edge(0, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 2)
g.add_edge(2, 3)
g.add_edge(3, 3)

source, destination = 0, 3
print(f"There is a path between {source} and {destination}: {g.has_path(source, destination)}")
```
<br>

## 14. Solve the problem of printing all _Paths from a source to destination_ in a Directed Graph with BFS or DFS.

### Problem Statement

Given a **directed graph** and two vertices $src$ and $dest$, the objective is to **print all paths** from $src$ to $dest$.

### Solution

1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)** Algorithm in Graphs: DFS is used because it can identify all the paths in a graph from source to destination. This is done by employing a **backtracking mechanism** to ensure that all unique paths are found.

2. To deal with **cycles**, a list of visited nodes is crucial. By utilizing this list, the algorithm can avoid revisiting and getting stuck in an infinite loop.

#### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: $O(V + E)$ 
  - $V$ is the number of vertices and $E$ is the number of edges. 
  - We're essentially visiting every node and edge once.

- **Space Complexity**: $O(V)$
  - In the worst-case scenario, the entire graph can be visited, which would require space proportional to the number of vertices. 

#### Implementation

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Python program to print all paths from a source to destination in a directed graph

from collections import defaultdict

# A class to represent a graph
class Graph:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        # No. of vertices
        self.V = vertices

        # default dictionary to store graph
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)

    def addEdge(self, u, v):
        self.graph[u].append(v)

    def printAllPathsUtil(self, u, d, visited, path):
        # Mark the current node as visited and store in path
        visited[u] = True
        path.append(u)

        # If current vertex is same as destination, then print current path
        if u == d:
            print(path)
        else:
            # If current vertex is not destination
            # Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex
            for i in self.graph[u]:
                if not visited[i]:
                    self.printAllPathsUtil(i, d, visited, path)

        # Remove current vertex from path and mark it as unvisited
        path.pop()
        visited[u] = False

    # Prints all paths from 's' to 'd'
    def printAllPaths(self, s, d):
        # Mark all the vertices as not visited
        visited = [False] * (self.V)

## 15. What is a _Bipartite Graph_? How to detect one?

A **bipartite graph** is one where the vertices can be divided into two distinct sets, $U$ and $V$, such that every edge connects a vertex from $U$ to one in $V$. The graph is denoted as $G = (U, V, E)$, where $E$ represents the set of edges.

### Detecting a Bipartite Graph

You can check if a graph is bipartite using several methods:

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is often used for this purpose. The algorithm colors vertices alternately so that no adjacent vertices have the same color.

#### Code Example: Bipartite Graph using BFS

Here is the Python code:

```python
from collections import deque

def is_bipartite_bfs(graph, start_node):
    visited = {node: False for node in graph}
    color = {node: None for node in graph}
    color[start_node] = 1
    queue = deque([start_node])

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()
        visited[current_node] = True

        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                queue.append(neighbor)
                color[neighbor] = 1 - color[current_node]
            elif color[neighbor] == color[current_node]:
                return False

    return True

# Example
graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'], 'B': ['A', 'C'], 'C': ['A', 'B', 'D'], 'D': ['C']}
print(is_bipartite_bfs(graph, 'A'))  # Output: True
```

#### Cycle Detection

A graph is not bipartite if it contains an odd cycle. Algorithms like **DFS** or **Floyd's cycle-detection** algorithm can help identify such cycles.
